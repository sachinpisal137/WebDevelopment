        <h1>Understanding Web Accessibility</h1>
        <p>Web accessibility refers to the inclusive practice of making websites usable for people of all abilities and
            disabilities. It ensures that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with
            websites effectively.</p>

        <h2>Core Principles of Web Accessibility:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Perceivable:</strong> Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in
                ways they can perceive.</li>
            <li><strong>Operable:</strong> User interface components and navigation must be operable.</li>
            <li><strong>Understandable:</strong> Information and the operation of the user interface must be
                understandable.</li>
            <li><strong>Robust:</strong> Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide
                variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance of WCAG Guidelines:</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</strong> provide detailed guidelines for making web
            content accessible. Following WCAG ensures that websites are usable by people with a wide range of
            disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological
            disabilities.</p>
        <p>Benefits of following WCAG guidelines include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enhancing usability for all users, including those with disabilities.</li>
            <li>Increasing audience reach and user engagement.</li>
            <li>Meeting legal requirements and avoiding potential lawsuits related to accessibility.</li>
            <li>Improving overall website quality and user satisfaction.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By adhering to web accessibility principles and WCAG guidelines, web developers contribute to a more
            inclusive and accessible online environment for everyone.</p>
